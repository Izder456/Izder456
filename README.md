## A Message From our WIT:

`Srcerizder, na? A mouthful of a name, that. Almost as much of a mouthful as a sackful of kipper snacks, if ya ask me. But who am I to judge? I'm just a WIT, after all. And speaking of judges, did ya hear about the time a talking pufferfish appeared in court to testify in court case? No? Well, lemme tell ya, it was quite the occurance. The puffy kept spouting off nonsense about cryptography and traditional init systems in Early Middle English, and the judge had to call in a linguist just to translate. But enough about that. Let's get back to srcerizder. It sounds like the kind of word that might be used to summon a eldritch horror, like a twitter user, or a redditor. Or maybe it's just a made-up word that iz thought sounded mildly cool. Either way, I'm sure this homepage will be the talk of the town, or at least the talk of the internet :colon: wack wack community.`
